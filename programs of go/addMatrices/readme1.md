Write a Golang program to find the sum of two matrices

Examples
Enter the elements of matrix A : 1 2 3 4
Enter the elements of matrix B : 4 3 2 1
The Addition of Two matrices :
5       5
5       5

Enter the elements of matrix A : 
1 2
3 4
Enter the elements of matrix B : 
4 3
2 1
The Addition of Two matrices :
5       5
5       5

Approach to solve this problem
Step 1: Create a three variables two for matrices values. 
Step 2: And one is for resultant matrix.
Step 3: Create a two variables for assign the values for FOR loop of two parameters of array.
Step 4: Write FOR loop with in the FOR loop.
