Write a Golang program to print the Fibonacci series 

Definition: In a Fibonacci series, the next number would be the summation of its two previous numbers, series starting from 0 and 1.

Examples
Print a fibonacci series up to num = 10;

Series: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, next is 13 but greater than 10;

Approach to solve this problem
Step 1: Define a function that accepts a numbers(num) type is int, till then need to print the series.
Step 2: Take two initial numbers for the series, i.e., 0 and 1.
Step 3: Start a true for loop and declare a third variable to store previous two values.
Step 4: Print the summation of two numbers until the summation is lesser than the given num.
